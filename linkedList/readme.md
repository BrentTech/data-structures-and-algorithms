# Singly Linked List
A linked list data structure with each node referencing the next node in the sequence.

## Challenge
Create a Linked List data structure with methods for adding, inserting, printing values, and includes.

## Approach & Efficiency
Time: O(n)
Space: O(1)

The approach to this task is focused on the relationship that each node has to another. Each node references just one other node that is the next in the sequence until it references null, at that point the list is complete.
