# Multi-bracket Validation.
Validate a string to ensure that all brackets open and close appropriately.

## Challenge
Write a function that will take in a string and return a boolean. This function should evaluate the string for round, curly, and square brackets. It should return True if they are all balanced, and False if they are out of balance.

## Approach & Efficiency
We approached this problem first knowing that we would be using a loop, likely a for loop. We really tried to see if we could get more efficient, but we couldn't. We designed our conditionals to give the most opportunity for an false response.
