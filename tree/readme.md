# Trees (Binary and Binary Search)
A tree data structure with each node referencing the node to the right and left. The node that you are on when referencing is the root. Binary Search Trees are ordered to have the smaller values on the left, and greater values on the right.

## Challenge
Create a Binary Tree data structure with methods for traversal in Pre-Order, In-Order, and Post-Order.

Create a Binary Search Tree data structure with methods for Add and Contains.

## Challenge 2
Extend the Binary Tree class with a method called Breadth First. This method will take in tree and traverse it using the Breadth First approach, printing out the value of each node.

## Challenge 3
Extend the Binary Tree class with a method called findMaxValue which returns the highest value stored in the tree.

## Approach & Efficiency
Binary Tree: O(n)
Binary Search Tree: O(log(n))

Breadth First -
Time: O(n)
Space: O(w)

Find Max Value -
Time: O(h)
Space: O(n)
