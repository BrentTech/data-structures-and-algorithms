# Trees (Binary and Binary Search)
A tree data structure with each node referencing the node to the right and left. The node that you are on when referencing is the root. Binary Search Trees are ordered to have the smaller values on the left, and greater values on the right.

## Challenge
Create a Binary Tree data structure with methods for traversal in Pre-Order, In-Order, and Post-Order.

Create a Binary Search Tree data structure with methods for Add and Contains.

## Approach & Efficiency
Binary Tree: O(n)
Binary Search Tree: O(log(n))
