# Breadth-First Traversal of a Graph

## Challenge
Write a function that takes in a graph, a starting vertex, and and ending vertex. Traverse the graph breadth first to find the edge that connects them.

## Approach & Efficiency
My approach was to struggle for about 2 hours on this problem and then use the breadth first traversal that Vinicio showed us. I wrote it out by hand a few times to ensure that I was at least getting muscle memory built up.

Efficiency is O(n). This is because the function tracks visited vertex.

## Solution
