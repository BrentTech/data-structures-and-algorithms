# Stacks and Queues
A stack data structure with each node referencing the previous node in the sequence, and a defined top.

A queue data structure with each node referencing the previous node in the sequence, and a defined front and rear.

## Challenge
Create a Stack and Queue data structure with methods for adding (push/enqueue), removing (pop/dequeue), and viewing (peek).

## Approach & Efficiency
Time: O(1)
Space: O(1)

The approach to this task involved the order that the pointer for top, front, or rear were associated with a node and how each node associated with each other.
