# Queue with Stacks

## Challenge
Impliment a Queue with two stacks. Inlcude the enqueue and dequeue methods. The Stack methods push(), pop(), and peek() are all available.


## Approach & Efficiency
Enqueue-
Time: O(1)
Space: O(1)

Dequeue-
Time: O(2n)
Space: O(2n)

Our approach to this solution involved first looking at the fundimental differences betweek the stack and queue processes for adding and removing nodes. We than limited ourselves to only the functions we had and problemsolved what would need to happen with the queue in order to replicate the functionality. After that we worked out the order that it would need to be done in and began testing.
